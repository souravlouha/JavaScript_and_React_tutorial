# Backend_Connect_to_Database
### Using java program and taking input from the user , students basic details update to Database.
### Here the backend Java code is linked to the database.
### Tools Required for project -> 1.Eclipse IDE or Eclipse workspace ; 2.using XAMPP as the Database
### In the first image,Here the database is created, the file name of that database is given as tmsl data, and the details of the students will be taken inside that tmsl data file. We will create columns here and create tables, in which the table will first have role, then name then email then mobile and then age.

###  In this image, the database already contains data for five students. In this database, the data for those five students is Role Name Email Mobile Age, here the Role is written as Int and AUTO_INCREMENT , name text , email text , mobile text , and age is Int type.
### We have inserted the data directly into the database here, manually.
### But in the next step, we will not manually load this data into the database, we will try to load the data with the help of backend Java programming.

### In this step we will use Eclipse IDE or Eclipse workspace. Through this we will write the Java programming, and after writing the programming, we will connect this part of the program to the database. Everything that is programmed in this Eclipse Workspace or Eclipse IDE is all part of the Backend.
### Here we are using XAMPP as the Database, XAMPP is a free software package that makes it easy to set up a local server on your computer. It includes everything you need to run a website or web application on your own computer for testing and development.

# 
#
### In this step, when we run Java programming in Eclipse ID or Eclipse workspace, then it will take user input in the console, such as Enter Username Enter Email ID Enter Mobile Enter Age.
### If we compare the console with the frontend here, it would not be wrong, here the console is actually playing the role of the frontend.

### In this case, if the data is saved, the words-> " Data saved !! "will appear, and if the data is not saved, the words -> "Not saved !! " will appear.
#
#
### In this case, after the user input, the data was uploaded to the database using the console. And we can see it in the database.

### In this way, we saw how the database of a website is connected to the backend, and how the backend is connected to the frontend (consol).The frontend of any website is actually used to take user input. The frontend and the backend are connected to each other through API. And that backend is connected to the database through various backend programming.
